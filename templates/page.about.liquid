    <h1 class="about-heading">"Vegan Dessert"</h1>
    <p class="about-paragraph">When I first went vegan I quickly found out how unappealing the "non-dairy" desserts were. They tasted dry, heavy, and dense (but not in a good way). For vegan desserts they really tasted <i>vegan</i>.</p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">But all of the good stuff was laden with dairy and eggs. After I couldn't find what I was looking for I decided to make it myself. And after being vegan for 11 years I have to give credit to the desserts I was baking (they made being vegan taste great).</p>

        <p class="about-founder-text">For a girl like me with the world's biggest sweet tooth, this just wouldn't do. I had to take matters into my own hands. So I started baking — and baking and baking!</p>
        <p class="about-founder-text">I baked till my oven pleaded for mercy and over fed my friends, co-workers, and boyfriend until he said "Heather, there are too many desserts in this house so please get rid of them — maybe even sell them."</p>
        <p class="about-founder-text">And that's what I did!</p>

    <h1 class="about-heading">Small Beginnings</h1>
    <p class="about-paragraph">In 2014 I bought a table at a local vegan market, came up with a name based off of my favorite Misfits song, and baked a ton of treats. I really didn't know what I was exactly doing at the time but I was having a lot of fun baking and hanging out with friends so I kept at it.</p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">For six years I've been hopping from one shared kitchen to another racing to bake as much as I could bring to these pop-ups and local markets — it really was a blast even without a proper shop.</p>

        <p class="about-founder-text">In 2019, after running "Pie Pie, My Darling" as a one-woman show for five years, I met a wonderful man named Christopher who moved to Chicago from St. Louis.</p>
        <p class="about-founder-text">He helped me follow through with my dream of opening up my very own bakery storefront. I started a gofundme to raise funds, and with the help of my amazing customers (and my incredible partner) I was finally able to open my own shop.</p>
        <p class="about-founder-text">Christopher has become an inherent part of this business and I feel lucky every single day to be working beside my best friend.</p>

    <p class="about-paragraph">It's been six year since then and now that I have a real, live shop and kitchen I've been able to grow more than I thought I would — and I'm so thankful the people that have helped me get to where I am and the customers that we've baked goodies for!</p>
    <p class="about-paragraph">Without any one of you I don't think we would have become what we are today — a true vegan bakery that stands up for what's right.</p>
