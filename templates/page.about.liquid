        <p class="about-founder-text">For a girl like me with the world's biggest sweet tooth, this just wouldn't do. I had to take matters into my own hands. So I started baking -- and baking and baking! I baked till my oven pleaded for mercy and over fed my friends, co-workers, and boyfriend until he said "Heather, there are too many desserts in this house so please get rid of them -- maybe even sell them."</p>
        <p class="about-founder-text">And that's what I did!</p>

    <h1 class="about-heading">Small Beginnings</h1>
    <p class="about-paragraph">In 2014 I bought a table at a local vegan market, came up with a name based off of my favorite Misfits song, and baked a ton of treats. For six years I've been hopping from one shared kitchen to another racing to bake as much as I could bring to these pop-ups and local markets -- it really was a blast even without a proper shop. Baking saved me from my previous addictions and mental problems that used to plague my life but now it all seems to have dissappeared.</p>

    <h1 class="about-heading">Thank You All</h1>
    <p class="about-paragraph">It's been six year since then and now that I have a real, live shop and kitchen I've been able to grow more than I thought I would -- and I'm so thankful the people that have helped me get to where I am and the customers that we've baked goodies for! Without any one of you I don't think we would have become what we are today -- a true vegan bakery that stands up for what's right.</p>
